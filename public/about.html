    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi There. I'm Dirk Oliver de Klerk, but you can simply call me Dirk. Allow me to share a bit about myself
       and what drives me.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I hail from the picturesque town of Vredendal in the Western Cape province of South Africa, where I was 
      raised with Afrikaans as my mother tongue. My family background is diverse; my mother is a dedicated home 
      education teacher at a local high school, while my father is a sheep farmer in the Northern Cape province.
       This upbringing instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deep connection to my roots.</p>
    <h2>Eductation and Profession</h2>
    <p>I pursued my passion for problem-solving and technology by studying Industrial Engineering
       at Stellenbosch University. Today, I work as an IT Security professional specializing in 
       Privilege Access Management (PAM). I'm genuinely passionate about this field and the opportunity
        it offers to make the digital world a safer place.</p>
    <h2>Aspiring Fullstack Developer</h2>
    <p>Beyond my IT security work, I'm on an exciting journey as an aspiring Fullstack developer.
       This website serves as the canvas for my development work, where I challenge the status quo
        and aim to create innovative solutions.</p>
    <h2>Motto</h2>
    <p>I live by the motto of challenging the status quo. Combining my love for IT security and development
       allows me to shed light on unconventional perspectives and contribute to making the world a better place to live in.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of IT and development, you'll find me pursuing my passion for golf. 
      Whether I'm behind my computer, crafting code, or out on the green, I relish the opportunity to chase 
      that elusive white ball and unwind.</p>
