<h1>Dirk's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Good Year</h3>
<p>
    This one stars Russel Growe and is based in France. Such a goodie and is the main reason why France is on my travel bucket list.
</p>
<h3>Spirit</h3>
<p>
    This is my favorite animation film ever. You try and watch it without crying! Love the Bryan Adams soundtrack.
</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
    This 1994 masterpiece starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is a must. A tale of hope and friendship set in a prison.
